This section showcases my analytical and technical work across various domains. Each project represents a unique challenge, solution, and learning experience that has contributed to my growth as a technical professional and analytical individual. I approach a lot of personal decision making with a lot of rigour as well, such that they also end up becoming projects of sorts. 

## Project Categories

My project portfolio includes:


- **Automation**: Tools and scripts that improve efficiency and reduce manual processes
- **Research Projects**: Independent research initiatives on things that catch my attention
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical analysis, visualization, and insight generation from complex datasets  
- **Experiments**: Testing and trying out new things that I come across and learn

## Technologies and Tools

My technical toolkit includes modern frameworks, languages, and development environments chosen based on project requirements rather than personal preference. I believe in using the right tool for the job and continuously learning new technologies as needed.
