## The Scene

This is another capture from an early morning bird walk. Getting up early, getting out with the right gear and an open mind.

## The Equipment

A Nikon Z-mount mirrorless body with an 800mm lens, on a shoulder strap - handheld.

## The Waiting Game

After spying this little thing - Himalayan Bulbul (*Pycnonotus leucogenys*) - rummaging around between these bamboo sticks, I wondered what it was up to. Bulbuls aren't exactly the types to be getting into such piles of wood, at least not in my experience. So I continued to watch it, ready with the camera up to my eyes, getting down to it's level. Waiting to see what's up...

## The Reward

It was collecting nesting material! Here is the evidence ... it delicately pulls out a fine strand of spider web, which it shall use to build it's nest.
