## The Scene

This is a small compilation of images where it's not a single bird alone, but the family together - either a couple going about their day, and at times even a full family, simply relaxing together or foraging for a meal.

## The Equipment

Assorted - as all of them were not captured together. A combination of zooms and an 800mm prime. Images have seen slight adjustment mostly for exposure and a bit of a tone curve ... I try to keep it simple and light handed in this department.

## The Waiting Game

Not much of a single waiting game here ... but the process of building a collection of images following a theme over a period of time. This page will see updates as the collection grows larger.

## The Reward
