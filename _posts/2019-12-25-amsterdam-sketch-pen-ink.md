A pen and ink rendering of a scene from one of my favourite cities - Amsterdam!

And who knew COVID was just round the corner, about to throw the world into chaos üòê...

## The Setup

A good setup is important for nice results - you need to be comfortable, you need to feel inspired.

{% include image.html index=0 %}

For this study, I worked with an image captured by me in May 2018.

It started with a light pencil sketch to get everything in place,

{% include image.html index=1 %}

And then, the first solid lines with a pen ... time to commit to the 'bigger picture' ...

{% include image.html index=2 %}

Once you have the main layout, getting into the details ... some parts are precise, some are loose ... trying to balance the two to keep true to the rendering in mind,

{% include image.html index=3 %}

Until it's done, and you have something that you are satisfied with,

{% include image.html index=4 %}

Hope you like it!
