## The Scene

This is from an early morning walk, looking for birds and some birdy action.

At a local park, I spot this hoopoe (*Upupa epops*) which seemed pretty hungry and was moving around rapidly, checking the grassy lawn for something to eat.

## The Equipment

A Nikon Z-mount mirrorless body with an 800mm lens, on a shoulder strap - handheld.

## The Waiting Game

As this fellow went about, I could anticipate that there were some interesting images to make.

I got down low, and started shooting a few bursts to try and capture some nice context-filled action images.

See a section of the series shot below ...

## The Reward

Eventually, I did get a bunch of interesting images, as the hoope successfully pulled out a juicy worm and happily swallowed it up!

Here are the three I have chosen to depict the action - predator over prey ... hunger satiated ... nature! These have undergone just some basic adjustments, like exposure and a bit of a tone curve. Further processing should help obtain even better results ... but I get lazy with this part of the work flow üòÅ
