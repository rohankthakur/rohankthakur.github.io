  <h2>I am Rohan</h2>
      <p>
        I have more than 14 years of experience in the P&C reinsurance sector, working with data at scale using various tools like Excel, VBA, SAS and SQL.  
      </p>
      <p> 
        In my spare time, I learn bits of Python, MySQL & Spark, mostly in the context of data processing and machine learning. And some HTML, CSS and JS along with D3 based libraries to visualise data.
      </p>
      <p> 
        Over the years, along with comprehensive technical work in my sub-domain, I have gained experience in people and technical leadership, process improvements & redesign, quality/Six Sigma/LEAN, project management and business development.
