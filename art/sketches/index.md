Sketching forms the foundation of my artistic practice. These works represent a combination of observational studies, creative explorations, and technical exercises designed to improve draftsmanship and visual understanding.

## Drawing Media and Techniques

My sketching practice employs various traditional media, each chosen for its specific qualities:

**Graphite Pencils** - Ranging from hard (2H-4H) for light construction lines to soft (4B-8B) for rich darks and textures. Ideal for detailed studies and tonal work.

**Charcoal** - Both vine and compressed charcoal for bold, expressive work with strong contrasts. Excellent for portraits and dramatic lighting studies.

**Ink** - Technical pens and brush pens for line work, cross-hatching, and wash techniques. Permanent and bold, requiring confident mark-making.

## Subject Matter

My sketching subjects include:

- **Portraits**: Studies of human expression, character, and emotion
- **Figure drawing**: Understanding anatomy, gesture, and movement  
- **Natural subjects**: Plants, animals, and landscape elements
- **Still life**: Objects arranged to study form, light, and composition
- **Urban sketching**: Capturing architecture and city life

## The Value of Drawing

Drawing serves multiple purposes in artistic development:

1. **Observation skills**: Learning to see accurately and critically
2. **Hand-eye coordination**: Developing muscle memory and control
3. **Problem-solving**: Working through compositional and technical challenges  
4. **Creative exploration**: Testing ideas before committing to finished works
5. **Meditative practice**: Finding focus and calm through repetitive mark-making

Each sketch in this collection represents not just a finished drawing, but a moment of learning and discovery in the ongoing journey of artistic development.
