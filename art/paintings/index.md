Painting allows for exploration of color, light, and atmosphere in ways that drawing cannot achieve. These works represent experiments in different media, techniques, and approaches to color and composition.

## Painting Media

Each medium offers unique characteristics and challenges:

**Watercolors** - Transparent, luminous, and unpredictable. Perfect for loose, atmospheric work and color studies. The medium teaches patience and planning due to its unforgiving nature.

**Acrylics** - Versatile, fast-drying, and permanent when dry. Can be used for both detailed work and loose, expressive paintings. Excellent for layering and texture work.

**Oils** - Traditional medium offering the longest working time and most blending possibilities. Ideal for portraits, detailed work, and paintings requiring subtle color transitions.

## Color Theory in Practice

My painting practice focuses on understanding color relationships:

- **Temperature contrasts**: Using warm and cool colors to create depth and interest
- **Value relationships**: Ensuring proper light and dark patterns regardless of color
- **Color harmony**: Exploring complementary, analogous, and triadic color schemes
- **Atmospheric perspective**: Using color temperature and saturation to suggest distance

## Painting Styles and Approaches

These works explore various approaches to painting:

**Alla Prima** - Direct painting completed in one session, emphasizing fresh brushwork and immediate color mixing.

**Glazing** - Building up transparent layers to achieve luminous color effects and subtle transitions.

**Impressionist techniques** - Broken color and visible brushstrokes to capture light and atmosphere.

**Abstract exploration** - Non-representational work focusing purely on color, form, and texture relationships.

## The Journey of Color

Painting has taught me that color is never seen in isolation - every hue is affected by its neighbors, the quality of light, and the surface it's painted on. Each painting is an experiment in these relationships, sometimes successful, sometimes instructive in different ways.

The works in this collection represent ongoing exploration of paint as a medium for both representation and pure visual experience.
